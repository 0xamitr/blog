    I was tired of choosing and solving questions on leetcode or gfg. So, I thought why not start giving contests. Issentially, griding 10 questions a day to 
    get to the top of my college ranking in gfg was kind of burning me out; contests, I thought dont require the same dedication, in terms of time that I need to invest.

    I went to leetcode and then codeforces and then codechef and the gfg (discontinued at that time) to look for when the next contest was, and, I had an Idea.
    So, I decided to build this app. Its a react native app, I only compile it to android because I dont care about IOS and the functionality I need (notifications, background functions) 
    won't work on web.

    I made an API in go, this was my first time ever using GO and it was okay.
