    I was getting burned out grinding LeetCode and GFG daily solving 10 questions a day just to climb my college leaderboard. It was draining.

    One day, I thought: instead of mindlessly choosing questions to solve, why not switch to contests? 
    They’re focused, time-bound, and more fun. Most importantly, they don’t require the same daily time commitment.

    So I went to LeetCode, then Codeforces, CodeChef, and finally GFG (which had discontinued contests at the time), 
    checking when the next contest was. That’s when the idea hit me; Why not build an app that shows all upcoming contests in one place?

    I built a React Native app (Android only; I don’t care about iOS and some functionality like notifications and background tasks 
    doesn’t work well on web anyway).

    For the backend, I wrote a simple API in Go; my first time using the language. It was a solid learning experience.

    Now, the app fetches contests from major platforms and sends me a notification every morning at 7AM telling me 
    how many contests are scheduled for the day. No more jumping across sites.
