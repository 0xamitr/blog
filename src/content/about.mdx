    I have been working on this blog for the past two days.
    I am using MDX to write my blog posts.
    **MDX** is pretty cool in a way that you combine markdown and good old JSX.
    Although it felt overwhelming to me in the beginning there is not much to it.

    React 19 is powerfull and with server components gives me the option to load all my content on the server.
    I mean how would you like to have a blog that loads in less than 100ms?
    > No API calls, no client side rendering, no javascript.

    Here is the techstack:
    - React 19
    - NextJs
    - MDX
    - TailwindCSS

    I had some problems in the beginning with having tailwind and using default markdown styles but [tailwind typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) came to the rescue.
    
    Well, lets see where mdx really shines. This Rocket that you see is not a static image but a react component. Rendered at run time. Isn't that cool?
