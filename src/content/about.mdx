    I have been working on this blog for the past two days.
    I am using MDX to write my blog posts.

    **MDX** is pretty cool in a way that you combine markdown and good old JSX.

    Although it felt overwhelming to me in the beginning there is not much to it. I decided not to go with a CMS because why the fuck not.


    React 19 is powerfull and with server components gives me the option to load all my content on the serverhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hgfvgh gfgh fghf hghfghfgh fghfgh fghfhg fghfhg gfhgf hgfghf bhjbjb jhhj hj hjbhjghjg hjg
