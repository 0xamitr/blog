   There’s a guy on YouTube who works at 7/11 and makes videos about his life. I played one of his videos in the background while I was pretending to code. He was playing a game on his computer, the good old minecraft, which made me go down a memory lane and I realised that things have changed.

They haven’t necessarily gone wrong, but they’re not the same. I’m not the same. Not the person I was five years ago, or ten.

I used to dream of growing up and playing video games all day. I loved them. Now, I barely touch them, and I hate that. It’s like a part of me is fading, and I don’t know how to get it back.

The optimism I once had? Gone. I can’t remember the last time I truly looked forward to something. The world feels like it’s spiraling, and nothing feels worth celebrating. The small joys of life—the ones that used to make everything worthwhile—don’t seem to exist anymore. What once felt like a dream now feels like a slow descent into something else.

I used to browse skyscrapercity for hours and that was best time, Infrastructure fascinated me and I enjoyed following all the interesting projects. Now, I don't even remember the last time I visited the site.
